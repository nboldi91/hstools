Multi-name bindings (field and value for puns)

Now signatures and function implementations are both considered definitions, making GoToDefinition slower.

Separate namespaces (for example data type and constructor name is not the same)

What is a definition anyway?
 - For normal functions
 - For class functions / instance definitions

Multi-case function definitions not parsed:

f :: Int -> Bool
f 0 = ...
f x = ...
^ this is not stored

Not working with Main module

Extend storing types to things that are not bindings.

Future plans:
 - Attach comments to names and show them in hovers
 - Rename refactoring
 - Detect compilation errors and show them in the IDE
 - Auto-complete support
  - Based on local and imported stuff
  - Based on modules that could be imported
  - Based on an indexing of a package universe
 - Show a visual indication of the current file being up-to-date
 - Try to keep things available even if the file is not up-to-date (at least track the position of the known elements)
