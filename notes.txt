Multi-name bindings (field and value for puns)

Don't store definitions that are generated from a TH expression. TH expression itself is stored now.

Now signatures and function implementations are both considered definitions, making GoToDefinition slower.

What is a definition anyway?
 - For normal functions
 - For class functions / instance definitions

Multi-case function definitions not parsed:

f :: Int -> Bool
f 0 = ...
f x = ...
^ this is not stored

Not working with Main module

Extend storing types to things that are not bindings.

Future plans:
 - Attach comments to names and show them in hovers
 - Rename refactoring
 - Detect compilation errors and show them in the IDE
 - Auto-complete support
  - Based on local and imported stuff
  - Based on modules that could be imported
  - Based on an indexing of a package universe
 - Show a visual indication of the current file being up-to-date
 - Try to keep things available even if the file is not up-to-date (at least track the position of the known elements)
