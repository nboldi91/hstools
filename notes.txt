Roadmap:

 - Show a visual indication of the current file being up-to-date
 - Detect compilation errors and show them in the IDE

Future plans:

  - Refine name-based info:
    - Multi-name bindings (field and value for puns)
    - What is a definition anyway?
      - For normal functions
      - For class functions / instance definitions
    - Extend storing types to things that are not bindings.
  - Attach comments to names and show them in hovers
  - Rename refactoring
  - Auto-complete support
  - Based on local and imported stuff
  - Based on modules that could be imported
  - Based on an indexing of a package universe
