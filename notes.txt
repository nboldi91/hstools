Multi-name bindings (field and value for puns)

Now signatures and function implementations are both considered definitions, making GoToDefinition slower.

What is a definition anyway?
 - For normal functions
 - For class functions / instance definitions

Not working with Main module

Extend storing types to things that are not bindings.

---

Future plans:
 - Attach comments to names and show them in hovers
 - Rename refactoring
 - Detect compilation errors and show them in the IDE
 - Auto-complete support
  - Based on local and imported stuff
  - Based on modules that could be imported
  - Based on an indexing of a package universe
 - Show a visual indication of the current file being up-to-date
 - Try to keep things available even if the file is not up-to-date (at least track the position of the known elements)
