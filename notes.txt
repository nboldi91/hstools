Multi-name bindings (field and value for puns)

instance X y where
  f = ...
  f should not be defined

store context
  - here f is not a definition

after a splice is in the code the definitions are not registered

Not working with Main module

Parse stage: create a mod summary record, store module Id
Rename stage: load the file path according to the module Id
